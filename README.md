Duplicate the `.env.template` file and rename the copy to `.env` inside the `/Auto-GPT` folder.

### 8. Edit the `.env` file
Open the `.env` file in a text editor. Note: Files starting with a dot might be hidden by your operating system.

### 9. Add email configuration settings
Append the following configuration settings to the end of the file:

```ini
################################################################################
### EMAIL (SMTP / IMAP)
################################################################################

EMAIL_ADDRESS=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com

#Optional Settings
EMAIL_MARK_AS_SEEN=False
EMAIL_SIGNATURE="This was sent by Auto-GPT"
EMAIL_DRAFT_MODE_WITH_FOLDER=[Gmail]/Drafts
```

1. **Email address and password:**
    - Set `EMAIL_ADDRESS` to your sender email address.
    - Set `EMAIL_PASSWORD` to your password. For Gmail, use an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).

2. **Provider-specific settings:**

## Installation

**_‚ö†Ô∏èThis is a work in progress‚ö†Ô∏è_**

Follow these steps to configure the Auto-GPT Plugins:

1. **Install Auto-GPT**

   If you haven't already, create a folder `Significant-Gravitas` and clone the [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) repository into the folder. Follow the installation instructions provided by [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT).
